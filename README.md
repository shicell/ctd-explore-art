# Code the Dream Advance Pre-Work: Explore Art
A website which will fulfill the requirements of the code the dream advance pre-work as it will makes calls to the Art Institute of Chicago API to allow for users to explore artwork.

As part of the advance pre-work required for entry into the code the dream program, I used the Art Institute of Chicago API to help with exploring and display art, their associated artist and some featured exhibitions. When clicking on the "Exhbit" Page, or upon load up, featured Exhbits from the Institure. Artist displays 10 random artist when navigated to. When clicking on the "view artworks" button, associated artworks can be anticipated to appear.

To gain access to this project, one can clone the repository and run on their local machine by clicking on the "index.html" page to begin.
